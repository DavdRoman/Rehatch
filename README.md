Rehatch
=======

The main problem when it comes to deleting all your tweets from your account is the Twitter API doesn't allow retrieval of tweets further than your last ~3000. Rehatch overcomes this problem by using your Twitter Archive instead.

## Usage

1. [__Create a Twitter application__](https://apps.twitter.com) in order to get a consumer key, consumer secret, access token and access token secret.
2. [__Download your Twitter Archive__](https://twitter.com/settings/account).
3. Run `rehatch`.
